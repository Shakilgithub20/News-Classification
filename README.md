# News-Classification Project
Classify news into categories based on their headline.
Various classifiers were tried - Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier, Multinomial Naive Bayesian Classifier, Multilayered Perceptron, Random Forest. Multinomial Naive Bayesian Classifier worked the best. It is logical for Multinomial Naive Bayesian to work the best as even we as humans classify based on keywords.
